### JAX
Jax is a Python library designed for high-performance ML research. Jax is nothing more than a numerical computing library, just like Numpy, but with some key improvements. It was developed by Google and used internally both by Google and Deepmind teams.

### Animate bivariate normal distribution
It is a special case, multi-variate distribution. It's parameters are the mean vector which will have 2 elements and a covariance matrix.
